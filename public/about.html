<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Joel Sancho and my passion is to become a full stack web developer, hence the reason for taking the complete web development Bootcamp course. So far it has been an amazing journey learning this new skill and I intend to master it. </p>

<p>I consider myself to be very hard working, team player, dedicate to complete a task or project once started, love to pay attention to details.It is because I respect other people's views that as enable me to work in many group settings, but i don't have a problem working by myself.</p>
